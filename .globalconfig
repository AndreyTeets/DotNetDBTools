# Project-level configuration options that apply to all the source files in a project, regardless of their file names or file paths.
# Useful when some project files reside outside the project folder.
# .editorconfig does not apply to source generated files because source generated files are not considered part of the directory tree on disk.
# .editorconfig has higher priority, so everything suppressed here and explicitly enabled in .editorconfig will only affect generated files.
